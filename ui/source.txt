Austrian supermarkets on Wednesday began handing out basic face masks to largely compliant shoppers before they become compulsory next week, though there remained some confusion about the new measure and uncertainty about its usefulness in fighting the coronavirus.
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Monday masks would soon be required in supermarkets and possibly later in public places in general.
"These masks are handed out in front of supermarkets," Kurz said. "It will be compulsory to wear them in supermarkets." He added that the goal was for people to wear them elsewhere in public, as well.
The masks are below medical grade, but Kurz said the new mandate would hopefully help slow the rate of infection.
"I am fully aware that masks are alien to our culture," he said. "This will require a big adjustment."
